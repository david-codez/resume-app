I was in charge of maintaining the exteriors of model homes and inventory homes for major homebuilders like Lennar, Meritage and Mattamy. This would involve traveling to various properties in south florida and working out of a trailer to do pressure washing and window cleaning as needed, also replacing light bulbs and ac filters. The company I worked for struggled after the Covid-19 pandemic and had to let go of several people including me. I ended up going back to Duffy's full time."
